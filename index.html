        <img src="images/pic.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Daniel Adetaba Adongo">
        <p> My name is Daniel Adetaba Adongo, and I hail from the northern part of Ghana. However, I currently reside in Cape Coast,
             a renowned destination known for its numerous tourist attractions. I have been happily married for three years and am blessed 
             with an adorable son who is less than a year old. Football brings me immense joy, and I often find relaxation and entertainment 
             in listening to music.Currently, I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Software Development at BYU-Idaho. This program is designed 
             to be completed in three years.  My primary goal in studying this course is to become a full stack developer. 
             I aspire to acquire expertise in this field and utilize it to solve problems effectively.

        <p> Ghana is a West African country on the Gulf of Guinea. Its neighbours are Côte d’Ivoire, to the west, Burkina Faso, which lies north, and Togo, to the east. Ghana is mainly flat, but there are hills in the northern part of the country. It has a central area of forest and sandy beaches along the coast. </p>

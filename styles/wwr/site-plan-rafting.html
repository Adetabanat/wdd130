        <h2> Overview</h2>
        <h3> Purpose</h3>
        <p>My goal is to develop a website that enables me to track and manage the sales of my product while also serving as an online platform for selling it.
             This website will play a crucial role in expanding my customer base and enhancing the efficiency of recording daily sales. 
             Additionally, I aim to focus on branding to establish a strong online presence and promote my business effectively.

            To achieve this, I will:
            Create a user-friendly website: I will design a website that is easy to navigate, visually appealing, and provides a seamless experience for customers to browse and purchase my product.
            The website will also include features to track and record daily sales.</p>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p> My target audience consists of individuals who have an interest in electronic appliances, specifically adults aged 18 years and above. 
             I will primarily focus on reaching the working class as my potential clients. 
            It is important to note that my audience may access my website using various devices, including laptops, desktops, and mobile devices. 
            Therefore, I will ensure that my website is optimized to provide a seamless experience across all these platforms.s </p>
